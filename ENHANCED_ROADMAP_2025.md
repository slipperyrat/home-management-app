    leaderboard: 'free', 
    mealPlanner: 'free',
    advancedAnalytics: 'pro',
    aiPredictions: 'pro'
  } as const;
  
  const required = featureMap[feature] ?? 'free';
  return required === 'free' || userPlan === 'pro';
}

// Usage in API routes
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { userData } = await getUserAndHousehold();
  
  if (!canAccessFeature(userData.plan, 'groceryAutoGen')) {
    throw new ServerError('Feature requires Pro plan', 403);

- Database query performance (95th percentile < 100ms)
- Cache hit rates (> 80%)
- Policy test coverage (100%)

### **User Engagement (Ongoing)**
- Daily/Monthly Active Users
- Feature adoption rates
- User retention rates
- Time spent in app

### **AI Effectiveness (Phase 1+)**

---

## üö® **Risk Mitigation & Watch Items**

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Google Calendar OAuth/Quotas**: Plan half-day for consent screen + scopes + tokens
2. **Email AI Throughput**: Cap token costs, add "dry-run" mode for debugging
3. **E2E Test Flakiness**: Seed known test user/household in Supabase
4. **Database Performance**: Monitor query performance, add slow-query logging

### **Operational Risks**
1. **Solo Development**: Keep scope focused, ship incrementally
2. **Integration Complexity**: Start with Google Calendar, defer other integrations
3. **AI Costs**: Monitor usage, implement rate limiting and cost controls

## üèÜ **Final Notes**

This roadmap builds on your **exceptional foundation** while addressing the technical debt that could slow future development. The key is to:

1. **Fix the foundation first** (Phase 0) - this will make everything else faster
2. **Keep scope focused** - ship core features before adding complexity
3. **Implement feature gating early** - prevents future technical debt
4. **Build for scale** - the recurrence model and audit logging will serve you well

Your app is already production-ready and could compete with established platforms. This roadmap will take it from excellent to exceptional while maintaining the high quality bar you've set.

**Remember**: You're ahead of schedule on several items. Focus on the foundation work first, and the feature development will be much smoother.
