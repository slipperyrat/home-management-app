## üìä **Current App Assessment: A+ (Excellent Foundation)**

### **What's Already Working Exceptionally Well**
- **Architecture**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript + Supabase with proper RLS
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade implementation (rate limiting, CSRF, input sanitization)
- **PWA**: Full offline support, push notifications, installable experience
- **AI Features**: Sophisticated email processing, meal suggestions, automation system
- **Gamification**: XP/rewards system, leaderboards, power-ups
- **State Management**: TanStack Query with proper caching strategies
- **Testing**: Good security tests, Playwright E2E setup
- **Chore Management**: Complete AI-powered chore assignment system with smart algorithms
- **Calendar System**: Full event management with RRULE recurrence, ICS export, and multi-view UI
- **Payment System**: Complete Stripe integration with checkout, webhooks, billing portal, and analytics
- **Feature Gating**: Enterprise-grade feature flags with admin dashboard and usage tracking

### **Technical Debt & Immediate Concerns**
- **Database**: Missing performance indexes, potential RLS UUID/TEXT casting issues
- **Testing**: Limited coverage beyond security functions
- **Monitoring**: Basic performance tracking, needs comprehensive observability
- **Offline Strategy**: Conflict resolution not defined
- **Type Safety**: Some API routes lack Zod validation

- Cache hit rates (> 80%)
- Feature flag test coverage (100%)

### **User Engagement (Ongoing)**

## ‚è∏Ô∏è **GOOGLE CALENDAR INTEGRATION POSTPONEMENT**

### **Status**: Code Complete, OAuth Setup Postponed
**Date**: September 19, 2025
**Reason**: App naming decision required before Google Cloud Console setup

### **What's Complete** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Full Google Calendar API Integration**: Complete OAuth2 flow, event import, calendar management
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: `google_calendar_imports` table with proper RLS policies
- ‚úÖ **API Endpoints**: Auth, callback, import, status, and cron job routes
- ‚úÖ **UI Components**: Calendar Sync page with connection status and import controls
- ‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing OAuth2 configuration
- ‚úÖ **Documentation**: Complete setup guide (`GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

### **What's Pending** ‚è∏Ô∏è
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Google Cloud Console Setup**: Requires app naming decision
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **OAuth2 Credentials**: Client ID, Client Secret, Redirect URI configuration
- ‚è∏Ô∏è **Environment Variables**: `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`

### **Next Steps** (When Ready)
1. **Decide on App Name**: Required for Google Cloud Console project
2. **Set up Google Cloud Project**: Follow `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
3. **Configure OAuth2 Credentials**: Add to `.env.local`
4. **Test Integration**: Verify calendar import functionality

### **Impact on MVP Launch**
- **Minimal Impact**: Google Calendar import is a Pro feature, not core to MVP
- **Calendar Sync Page**: Shows helpful error message instead of crashing
- **All Other Features**: Unaffected and ready for launch

---

## üö® **Risk Mitigation & Watch Items**

### **Technical Risks**
1. **Google Calendar Quotas**: Monitor usage, implement proper backoff
2. **Feature Flag Complexity**: Monitor flag interactions and performance impact
3. **Mobile PWA Performance**: Monitor iOS Safari compatibility and performance
4. **Stripe Integration**: Ensure proper webhook handling and error recovery

### **Operational Risks**
1. **Launch Timeline**: 8 weeks is aggressive; maintain buffer for critical issues
2. **Feature Scope**: Keep MVP focused, defer complex features to post-MVP
3. **Support Load**: Prepare for increased support during launch
4. **Compliance**: Ensure privacy/consent features meet Australian requirements
