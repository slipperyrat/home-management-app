# UI Lint Override During Redesign

Date: 2025-10-09

We introduced a temporary ESLint override for `src/components/ui/**/*` so the legacy UI patterned components stop blocking builds (they produced dozens of style warnings and leaked-render hints).

Reason: we plan to replace the entire UI system soon, so sinking time into cleaning up the old components doesnâ€™t provide value. Instead, the override lets us proceed with other lint fixes and code changes.

Reminder: once the new UI lands, remove the override block in `.eslintrc.json` (search for the override on `src/components/ui`). Re-run `npm run lint` to confirm the new UI complies with the stricter rules.
