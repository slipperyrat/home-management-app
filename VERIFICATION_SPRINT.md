# üîç Verification Sprint - Lock Down Completed Items

*Based on roadmap review analysis - prove the ‚úÖ completed items with concrete artifacts*

## üéØ **Goal**
Verify the items marked as "‚úÖ COMPLETED" in the roadmap to prevent wishful thinking and ensure we have solid proof before moving to Phase 1.

---

## üìã **Items to Verify (Priority Order)**

### 1. **‚úÖ RLS Audit & Fixes** - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Check for explicit auth.uid() casts
grep -r "auth\.uid()" supabase/ --include="*.sql" | grep -E "::text|::uuid"

# Test RLS policies with sample data
# Run the test harness from roadmap on a seeded database
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Explicit `auth.uid()::text` or `auth.uid()::uuid` casts where needed
- [ ] Allow/deny tests for owner/member/outsider roles
- [ ] CI job that seeds + runs RLS policy tests
- [ ] All policies tested with test harness

**Artifact Required:** 
- RLS policy test results showing all policies work correctly
- CI pipeline that runs these tests automatically

---

### 2. **üîÑ Security Hardening (Headers + Rate Limiting)** - **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Check security headers
curl -I https://your.app/ | grep -E "strict-transport-security|content-security-policy|x-frame-options"

# Test rate limiting
for i in {1..30}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://your.app/api/test; done | grep 429
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Global security headers coverage (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- [ ] Rate limiting triggers 429 on burst requests (not just single routes)
- [ ] Limiter wraps auth and webhook routes
- [ ] Health checks excluded from rate limiting

**Artifact Required:**
- curl output showing all security headers

---

### 3. **‚úÖ Error Handling/Logging Foundation** - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```bash
# Check for structured logging
grep -r "logger\." src/ --include="*.ts" | head -10

WHERE table_name = 'audit_log' ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check for audit logging in API routes
SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY at DESC LIMIT 5;
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**

---

### 5. **‚úÖ E2E Testing Foundation** - **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```bash

# Look for Playwright report artifacts
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] 115/115 tests passing consistently
- [ ] Runs in CI on seeded DB
- [ ] Fails build on any regression
- [ ] Playwright HTML report published as artifact

**Artifact Required:**

---

### 6. **üîÑ Performance Indexes** - **LOW PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```sql
-- Check if indexes exist
SELECT indexname, tablename FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename IN ('shopping_items', 'shopping_lists', 'household_members', 'chores', 'meal_plans')
ORDER BY tablename, indexname;

-- Add missing indexes if needed
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS shopping_items_list_complete_idx ON shopping_items (list_id, is_complete);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS shopping_lists_household_idx ON shopping_lists (household_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS household_members_household_user_idx ON household_members (household_id, user_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS shopping_items_created_idx ON shopping_items (created_at);
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All recommended indexes exist
- [ ] Query performance improved
- [ ] Database monitoring shows better performance

**Artifact Required:**
- Database index list showing all recommended indexes exist
- Performance metrics showing improvement

---

### 7. **üîÑ Recurrence Model** - **LOW PRIORITY**
**Quick Verification Steps:**
```sql
-- Check if RRULE columns exist
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name IN ('chores', 'calendar_events') 
AND column_name IN ('rrule', 'dtstart');
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] RRULE text column exists and is used
- [ ] Server-side expansion to instances for next N weeks

## üìù **"Definition of Done" Snippets**

```

### **Security Headers:**
```
CSP: script-src 'self' plus known third-parties
HSTS: preload
X-Frame-Options: DENY
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### **Audit Log:**
```sql
-- table + insert helpers; view in admin; retention policy (e.g., 180 days)
```

### **CI Proofs:**
- [ ] Publish Playwright HTML, Lighthouse JSON, and k6 summary as build artifacts
- [ ] Badges in README

## ‚è∞ **Timeline**

**Week 1:** Complete verification sprint (items 1-7 above)
**Week 2:** Start Phase 1 - Today View + Digest (highest ROI)
**Week 3:** Continue Phase 1 - Meal ‚Üí Shopping Auto-merge

**Success Metrics:**
- All verification items have concrete artifacts
- Phase 1 features have clear acceptance criteria
- CI/CD pipeline includes all quality gates
- Documentation updated with proof of completion

---

## üéØ **Success Criteria**

By the end of this verification sprint:
1. **All ‚úÖ completed items have concrete proof**
2. **All üîÑ partially completed items have clear completion criteria**
3. **Phase 1 priorities are defined with acceptance criteria**
4. **CI/CD pipeline includes quality gates for all completed items**
5. **Roadmap accurately reflects current state**

This prevents roadmap drift and ensures we build on a solid, verified foundation.
